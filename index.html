            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            The goal of this game is to help this little amoeba grow to become the king of the world!<br>
            Feed him by buying berry bushes or trees. Rocks will help to protect you against natural<br>
            disasters that may come your way. When your little amoeba grows big and strong, it will<br>
            begin to evolve! Help it choose the best path so it can defeat the <i>current</i> king<br>
            and take over the throne!
